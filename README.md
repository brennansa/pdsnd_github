### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data Using Python

### Description
As bicycle sharing systems become more popular, it is important to capture the data and understand how customers are using these systems.  The objective of this project was to compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC using raw data from the first half of 2017 using Python coding.  A variety of statistics showing bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington can be computed with user input. These statisics include:

* **Popular times of travel**
  * Most common month, day of week, and hour of day
* **Popular stations and trip**
  * Most common start station, most common end station and most common trip from start to end
* **Trip duration**
  * Total travel time and average travel time
* **User information**
  * Counts of user type; user gender(NYC and Chicago); earliest, most recent, common birth year(NYC and Chicago)
